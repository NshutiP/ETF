#python3 program to find Euler’s Totient function values for randomly generated keys using prime numbers


Euler's theorem states that, “if p and q are relatively prime, then ”, where φ is Euler's totient function for integers. That is, is the number of non-negative numbers that are less than q and relatively prime to q. Euler’s Totient function Φ(n) for an input n is count of numbers in {1, 2, 3, …, n} that are relatively prime to n, i.e., the numbers whose GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) with n is 1.


The program Randomly picks two prime numbers from a given range, the first output random number is p and the second output is q.

The program then proceeds to pass the randomly generated keys through a function that will return the Euler's totient function values.
